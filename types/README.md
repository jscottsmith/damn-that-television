# Prismic Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions for your Prismic integration.

## Files

- `prismicio-types.d.ts` - **Auto-generated types** - Generated by Slice Machine from your Prismic repository

## Usage

The generated types in `prismicio-types.d.ts` are imported and used throughout your application. These types are automatically generated from your actual Prismic schema and provide full type safety.

## When to Update Types

### Generated Types (`prismicio-types.d.ts`)

This file is automatically generated by Slice Machine when you:

- Add new document types in Prismic
- Add new slice types in Prismic
- Modify existing field structures
- Add new fields to existing types

**When to regenerate:**

- Run `pnpm run slicemachine` to start Slice Machine
- Make changes to your slices in the Slice Machine UI
- Types are automatically updated when you save changes

## Setup

The Slice Machine tool is configured to:

- Generate types from your local slice definitions
- Provide a visual interface for managing slices
- Automatically update types when you make changes
- Generate comprehensive types with full documentation

## Best Practice

1. Use Slice Machine UI (`pnpm run slicemachine`) to manage your slices
2. The generated types include detailed documentation for each field
3. All types are automatically kept in sync with your slice definitions
4. No manual type maintenance required!
5. Types are generated in the root `prismicio-types.d.ts` file for easy importing
