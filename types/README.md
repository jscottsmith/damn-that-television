# Prismic Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions for your Prismic integration.

## Files

- `prismic-generated.ts` - **Auto-generated types** - Generated by `prismic-ts-codegen` from your Prismic repository

## Usage

The generated types in `prismic-generated.ts` are imported and used throughout your application. These types are automatically generated from your actual Prismic schema and provide full type safety.

## When to Update Types

### Generated Types (`prismic-generated.ts`)

This file is automatically generated by running:

```bash
pnpm run prismic:codegen
```

**When to regenerate:**

- You add new document types in Prismic
- You add new slice types in Prismic
- You modify existing field structures
- You add new fields to existing types

## Setup

The codegen tool is configured to:

- Fetch types from your Prismic repository using the Custom Types API
- Use the `PRISMIC_CUSTOM_TYPES_API_TOKEN` from your `.env.local` file
- Generate comprehensive types with full documentation

## Best Practice

1. Run `pnpm run prismic:codegen` whenever you update your Prismic schema
2. The generated types include detailed documentation for each field
3. All types are automatically kept in sync with your Prismic repository
4. No manual type maintenance required!
