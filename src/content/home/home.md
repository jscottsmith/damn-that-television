## Hello.

Hi there, I'm J Scott Smith. Currently, I've been heads down making things on the web for [HAUS](https://madeinhaus.com) in Hollywood. Here's a few of those projects to click on: [Put Your Profile on the Line](https://madeinhaus.com/work/nfl-pypotl), [Life's Good When You Play More](https://madeinhaus.com/work/lg-g5), and [Ford By Design](https://madeinhaus.com/work/fordooh).

Or jump over to some of my experiments on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/). Here's a few of my favorites: [Fluid Image](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/NgVapp), [Theremin Oscillator](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/dRBOzE), and [Confetti Cannon](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/VjPaLO).

Or just hang out here and kill some TVs with other emojis. Just click [Play]. Oh right -- why Damn that TV? Because telelvision is oppressing my creativity and this is my rebellion. Plus it happens to be the greatest intro to one of my favorite songs by the [Talking Heads](LINK).

Ok, later.
