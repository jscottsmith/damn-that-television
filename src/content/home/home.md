## Hello.

Hi there 👋🏻, I'm J Scott Smith. Currently, I've been heads down making things on the web for [HAUS](https://madeinhaus.com) in Hollywood 🌴. Here's a few of those projects to click on: [Put Your Profile on the Line](https://madeinhaus.com/work/nfl-pypotl), [Life's Good When You Play More](https://madeinhaus.com/work/lg-g5), and [Ford By Design](https://madeinhaus.com/work/fordooh).

Or jump over to some experiments on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/). Here's a few of my favorites: [Fluid Image](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/NgVapp), [Theremin Oscillator](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/dRBOzE), and [Confetti Cannon](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/VjPaLO).

Or just hang out here and kill some TVs with emojis 📺✊🏼💥. Oh right -- why the domain *Damn that TV*? Because TV has been attempting to kill my creativity. Plus it happens to be the greatest intro to one of the greatest songs by the [Talking Heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZVEMzvZIY).

Ok, later.
