## Hi there, I'm J. 👋🏻

Lately I’m busy developing products for [GumGum](https://gumgum.com/) to support their computer vision 👁 ad tech business in Santa Monica 🏖. I’m focused on making web apps more user-friendly, performant, and accessible while writing code that is tested, scalable and maintainable.

Before that I was heads down making hip things for the web at [HAUS](https://madeinhaus.com) in Hollywood 🌴. Here's a few I had my hands in: [Put Your Profile on the Line](https://madeinhaus.com/work/nfl-pypotl), [Life's Good When You Play More](https://madeinhaus.com/work/lg-g5), and [Ford By Design](https://madeinhaus.com/work/fordooh).

Ocassionally I’ll flex 💪🏻 my creative side and concoct some experiments on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/). Here's a few of my favorites: [Tube Dudes](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/full/yEMeaa/), [Theremin Oscillator](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/dRBOzE), and [Confetti Cannon](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/VjPaLO).

That’s the gist but if you want some more details here's a [résumé](https://damnthat.tv/resume). Also feel free to hang out here and kill some TVs with emojis 📺✊🏻💥. Oh right -- why the domain _Damn that TV_? Because TV has been killing my creativity. Plus, it's got to be the greatest intro ever to a song by the [Talking Heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZVEMzvZIY).

Ok, later.
