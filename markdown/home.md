Hi there 👋🏻, I'm J.

Right now I'm probably out building things for the web using all the latest tech. Lately, that's been for [GumGum](http://gumgum.com) in Santa Monica 🏖. where I'm working with the Web Engineering team to build a few different products that support our Advertising business. I also make an effort to contribute to some open source for [Gumdrops](https://github.com/gumgum/gumdrops), a React UI component library, and a couple of my own React NPM components, [react-scroll-parallax](https://github.com/jscottsmith/react-scroll-parallax), and [react-observed](https://github.com/jscottsmith/react-observed).

Before that I was heads down making interactive things on the web for [HAUS](https://madeinhaus.com) in Hollywood 🌴. Here's a few of those projects to peep 👀 at: [Put Your Profile on the Line](https://madeinhaus.com/work/nfl-pypotl), [Life's Good When You Play More](https://madeinhaus.com/work/lg-g5), and [Ford By Design](https://madeinhaus.com/work/fordooh).

I also still try and flex 💪🏻 some creative skills by making quick experiments at [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/). Here's a few of my favorites: [Fluid Image](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/NgVapp), [Theremin Oscillator](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/dRBOzE), and [Confetti Cannon](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/VjPaLO).

Or just hang out here and kill some TVs for me 📺✊🏻💥. Oh right -- why the domain _Damn that TV_? Because TV has been really killing my creativity and it happens to be the greatest intro to one of my favorite [Talking Heads tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZVEMzvZIY).

Later!
