## Hi there, I'm J 👋🏻

Right now I'm an engineer over at [Fair](https://fair.com) working to expand and improve their platform that allows people to easily get a car on their phone 🚘👌🏻. My focus is on making web apps more user-friendly, performant, and accessible while writing code that is tested, scalable and maintainable.

Occasionally I’ll exercise my creative side and concoct some experiments on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/). Here's a few faves: 🕺🏻 [Tube Dudes](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/full/yEMeaa/), 🔥 [Bitfire](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/dwZjWK), and 🎉 [Confetti Cannon](https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/VjPaLO).

That’s the gist but if you want some more details here's a [résumé](/resume). Also feel free to hang out and kill some TVs with emojis 📺✊🏻💥. Oh right -- why the domain _Damn that TV_? Because TV has been killing my creativity. Plus, it's got to be the greatest intro ever to a song by the [Talking Heads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6ZVEMzvZIY).

Ok, later.
