## Hi there, I'm J 👋🏻

Never thought I'd be working for bank but here I am as an engineer over at <a href="https://www.hmbradley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HMBradley</a> building a new banking experience that rewards people who save. My focus continues to be making web apps more user-friendly, performant, and accessible while writing code that is tested, scalable and maintainable.

Occasionally I’ll exercise my creative side and concoct some experiments on <a href="https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodePen</a>. Here's a few faves: 🕺🏻 <a href="https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/full/yEMeaa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tube Dudes</a>, 🔥 <a href="https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/dwZjWK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitfire</a>, and 🎉 <a href="https://codepen.io/jscottsmith/pen/VjPaLO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Confetti Cannon</a>.

That’s the gist but if you want some more details here's a [résumé](/resume). You can also help out and [kill some damn TVs](the-damn-game) with emojis 📺✊🏻💥 before they threaten to crush my creativity. I find this

👌🏻Cya!
